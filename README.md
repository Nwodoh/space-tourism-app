## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
While Building This Project, I focused strengthening my SASS and css Flexbox skills, so I made use of alot of them. Plus Every Page's content(Except the main Navigation at the top) is entirely source from a local Json database Using Javascript. Here is how my main tag Looks LikeüòÅüòÖ

```html
<main>
    <!-- CODE FROM JS GOES HERE -->
 </main>
```
Plus I use Mixins to Handle all responsiveness, Here is a small snippet:
```scss
@mixin respond($breakpoint) {
  @if $breakpoint == mainTab {
    @media screen and (max-width: 56.25em) {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
```
I use the MVC architechture for t=my Javascript

### Continued development

Going on From Here, I would continue my Learning learnings with React and Next.js to complete my MERN stack goal.
